### My Portfolio (old)
This is my website portfolio, built previously using [https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/) Markdown, Liquid, HTML, and CSS go in, and static sites come out ready for deployment.

The Jekyll gem provides a [Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/) executable that you can use in your terminal.

The jekyll program has several commands, and the structure is always as follows:
[argument] [option] [argument_to_option]

Examples:
    jekyll new site/ --blank
    jekyll serve --config _alternative_config.yml


## To run this app:

First, run the development server:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
